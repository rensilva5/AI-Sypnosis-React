          “MissionWired was with the Biden campaign from the very beginning and
          helped build the fundraising infrastructure starting during the
          primary. They are fast, responsive, and intuitively understand the
          digital fundraising space. I'm glad we called on them when we did,”
          says Patrick Bonsignore, Paid Media Director of the Biden-Harris for
          President team.
